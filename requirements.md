# Project Name: SmashVision AI
## Democratizing Elite Sports Analytics for Bharat

### 1. Problem Statement
India is experiencing a sports revolution, yet elite-level coaching remains inaccessible to 99% of aspiring athletes.
* **The Gap:** Professional badminton coaching and analytics (like Hawk-Eye) are expensive and restricted to top urban academies.
* **The Pain Point:** Student athletes in Tier-2/3 cities ("Bharat") rely on subjective feedback, leading to uncorrected technical flaws and stagnation.
* **The Opportunity:** Most rural households now possess a smartphone, but lack a tool to transform it into a scientific coaching aid.

### 2. Proposed Solution
**SmashVision AI** is a "Pocket Coach" that uses computer vision to democratize sports analytics.
* **Core Concept:** A mobile-first platform that analyzes badminton match/practice video using on-device and cloud-based AI to extract professional metrics (speed, agility, reaction time) without wearable sensors.
* **The "Bharat" Angle:** It provides feedback in local Indian languages (Vernacular AI) and offers nutrition plans based on locally available, affordable foods.

### 3. Key Features
1.  **Zero-Hardware Analytics:** Tracks reaction time, jump height, and court coverage using just a standard phone camera.
2.  **AI Technical Coach:** Generates corrective advice (e.g., "Your lunge depth is too shallow") using Generative AI.
3.  **Vernacular Support:** Delivers coaching insights in 8+ Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.) via AWS Translate.
4.  **Ghost Mode:** visually overlays the user's movement against a professional player's skeleton for direct technique comparison.
5.  **Smart Nutritionist:** Suggests post-workout meals based on intensity and local diet preferences (e.g., Sattu, Ragi).

### 4. Target Audience
* **Primary:** Student athletes (ages 10-22) in semi-urban and rural India.
* **Secondary:** District-level coaches managing large batches of students.
* **Institutional:** Government bodies (Khelo India) looking for a scalable talent scouting tool.

### 5. Social Impact
* **Talent Identification:** Enables remote scouting of high-potential athletes from remote villages based on objective data.
* **Injury Prevention:** Identifies dangerous biomechanics (e.g., valgus knee stress) early to prevent long-term injury.
